Add a book to a table (Dashboard Widget for WordPress)
======================================================

1. Import the table in MySQL.
2. Zip and install libri.php.

#### bybliographic.sql

This file will format a sql query as a bybliographic file. Perhaps a PHP or Python class would do a better job.

Pybliographic will format books somewhat like this:

~~~~
@Book{RWDHandbook,
  Author         = {{Future Publishing}},
  Title          = {The {R}esponsive {W}eb {D}esign {H}andbook},
  Publisher      = {Future Publishing},
  year           = 2014
}
~~~~~
